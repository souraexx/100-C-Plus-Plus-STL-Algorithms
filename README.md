# About

This is a collection of 100+ C++ STL library algorithms with examples.

It is for personal purposes only.

The examples are self-explanatory and can be used to write more expressive C++ code.

Can be very useful in competitive coding.

Almost all the names of the .cpp files are the name of the algorithm.

In some cases, few algorithms are merged into a single file.

## Acknowledgement

Most of the examples are taken from the following websites:-

All of the algorithms are explained in this single YouTube video:-
